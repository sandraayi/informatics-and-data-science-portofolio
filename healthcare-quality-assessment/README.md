# Healthcare Quality Assessment: Readmission and LOS Analysis  
**Excel-Based Quality Improvement Project | UIC Academic Exercise**

## Summary  
This Excel-based project simulated a real-world quality improvement (QI) initiative using de-identified hospital discharge data. The goal was to clean, transform, and analyze clinical and operational data to assess quality metrics such as readmissions and length of stay (LOS). The exercise mirrors foundational steps in healthcare QI and performance analytics.

## Key Tasks  
- **Data Cleaning** – find/replace, format standardization  
- **Facility Code Mapping** – linking IDs to names  
- **Readmission Analysis** – grouping diagnosis codes and visualizing frequency  
- **LOS Trends** – calculating and comparing length of stay across records  
- **Code Lookup Table Use** – integrating external mappings for diagnoses

## Sheet Guide  
| Sheet Name         | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `OriginalDataSet`  | Raw hospital records for patients, facilities, and visits |
| `Q1–Q5`            | Data cleaning and format standardization |
| `Q6–Q9`            | Diagnosis code grouping and frequency analysis |
| `Q10–Q13`          | Length of stay (LOS) calculations and filtering |
| `Q15 Lookup Table` | Diagnosis code reference mapping |

## Tools Used  
Microsoft Excel – Conditional formatting, lookup tables, filters, sorting, data transformation

## Clinical Relevance  
Hospital administrators and quality officers rely on these types of analyses to make data-driven decisions, optimize resource use, and improve patient outcomes. This project reflects early exposure to operational informatics and QI data handling.

###Summary Table
| Facility ID | Medical Center | Average LOS (days) | Readmission Rate (%) | Total Discharges |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 5           | Center A       | 4.94                | 13.6                   | 884               |
| 8           | Center B       | 4.3                 | 11.5                   | 408               |
