## 📊 Data Summary

- **Claim Types**: Inpatient, Outpatient, Home Health, Skilled Nursing Facility, Hospice, Durable Medical Equipment, and Carrier  
- **Metrics**: Average spending per episode (hospital, state, nation); Percent contribution of hospital and state spending to national benchmarks  
- **Coverage**: Data from all 50 states, 3,059 hospitals, various service periods  
- **Source Note**: All data is aggregated and de-identified per CMS standards and released as a Public Use File (PUF)

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 1. Spending by Claim Type
- Inpatient and SNF (Skilled Nursing Facility) claims had the highest average per-episode costs.  
- Durable Medical Equipment (DME) and Carrier claims showed significantly lower per-episode costs.  
- Outpatient costs demonstrated substantial variation across states and providers, suggesting diverse usage patterns or pricing structures.

### 2. State-Level Variation
- States like Texas, California, New Jersey, and Louisiana consistently ranked in the top 10 for highest average spending per episode.  
- Lower-spending states included those in the Midwest and parts of the Mountain region.  
- Variation may reflect differences in local practice patterns, cost of living, or population health needs.

### 3. Hospital-Level Disparities
- Certain hospitals (e.g., large academic or specialty centers) showed episode spending 2–3x higher than their state average.  
- This suggests either a concentration of high-acuity patients or differing billing practices.

### 4. State vs Hospital Spending Comparison
- Several states had narrow gaps between their average hospital and state spending, indicating consistent care delivery.  
- Others revealed wide disparities, flagging potential quality, equity, or efficiency concerns within the state.

### 5. Top 10 Analyses
- Visualizing top 10 hospitals and states by spending brought clarity to outliers.  
- Highlighted where Medicare spending is most concentrated—potential starting points for deeper value-based care or cost reduction efforts.
