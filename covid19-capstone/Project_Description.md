# COVID-19 Capstone Project: Predicting SARS-CoV-2 Test Outcomes Using Laboratory Data

This capstone project explores the use of machine learning to predict COVID-19 test results using routine laboratory values. In resource-limited settings where universal testing is not feasible, a reliable algorithm could assist clinicians in triaging suspected cases and prioritizing testing and care.

## Project Objective  
To develop a predictive model for COVID-19 diagnosis using publicly available clinical data aggregated from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Brazil). The model identifies patterns in lab test results that correlate with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR outcomes.

## Methods  
- Data cleaning, feature selection, and exploratory analysis using Python and pandas  
- Machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines  
- Model evaluation using precision, recall, and AUC-ROC scores  
- Visualization of key predictors and their contribution to classification performance

## Relevance to Clinical Practice  
As a physician with frontline experience during the pandemic, I approached this project with a real-world perspectiveâ€”balancing clinical urgency with operational constraints. This project showcases my ability to apply informatics tools to solve pressing healthcare challenges and reflects my broader interest in data-driven clinical decision support.

## Key Outcomes  
- Identified key laboratory markers (e.g., leukocyte count, eosinophils) associated with COVID-19 positivity  
- Developed a predictive framework that could support targeted testing strategies in high-burden environments  
- Reinforced the role of health informatics in optimizing pandemic response

## Social Impact  
The model could help reduce testing bottlenecks, support equitable resource allocation, and enable earlier initiation of treatment for high-risk patients.
