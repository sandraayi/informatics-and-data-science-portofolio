# Project Description – COVID-19 Impact Forecasting Capstone

This capstone project, developed as part of the UT Austin PGP Data Science and Business Analytics program, focuses on modeling the progression and impact of COVID-19 across different regions using publicly available datasets.

## Objective
To apply advanced analytics and forecasting models to understand:
- The spread and peaks of COVID-19 cases over time
- The influence of interventions on case trajectories
- Regional variations and data quality insights

## Tools and Methods
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, statsmodels
- **Techniques:** Time series analysis, regression, ARIMA, LSTM (optional), feature engineering, data cleaning

## Data Source
Publicly available COVID-19 data originally released by Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Brazil, aggregated from global and national health agency records.

## Key Contributions
- Preprocessed real-world epidemiologic data
- Forecasted trends under different public health scenarios
- Visualized outcomes to inform response strategies

## Files Included
- Jupyter Notebook (`COVID19_Forecasting.ipynb`)
- This Project Description (`Project_Description.md`)
- Sample visualizations and model outputs
