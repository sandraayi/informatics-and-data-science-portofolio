# Heart Failure Risk Classification Using MIMIC-III EHR Data  
**UIC Academic Programming Project**

## Summary  
This project explores the application of supervised machine learning to classify patients at risk of heart failure based on lab data derived from electronic health records (EHR). Developed as part of a course assignment at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC).

## Key Highlights  
- Dataset included real-world anonymized lab test results and patient metadata  
- Cleaned and preprocessed data with Pandas and NumPy  
- Visualized relationships between variables using correlation plots and histograms  
- Applied classification models: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest  
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices  
- Emphasized model interpretability using feature importance rankings

## Tools Used  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

## Clinical Relevance  
Predictive tools like these can support early intervention and care planning for patients at risk of congestive heart failure.
